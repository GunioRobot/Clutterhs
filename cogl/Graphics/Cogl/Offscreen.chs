-- | This creates an offscreen buffer object using the given texture
-- as the primary color buffer. It doesn't just initialize the
-- contents of the offscreen buffer with the texture; they are tightly
-- bound so that drawing to the offscreen buffer effectivly updates
-- the contents of the given texture. You don't need to destroy the
-- offscreen buffer before you can use the texture again.
--
-- Note: This does not work with sliced Cogl textures.
--
-- [@handle@] A CoglHandle for a Cogl texture
--
-- [@Returns@] @Just@ a CoglHandle for the new offscreen buffer or
-- @Nothing@ if it wasn't possible to create the buffer.
--
{# fun unsafe offscreen_new_to_texture as ^
  { withOffscreen* `Offscreen' } -> `Maybe Texture' maybeNewTexture* #}


-- | This redirects all subsequent drawing to the specified draw
-- buffer. This can either be an offscreen buffer created with
-- 'offscreenNewToTexture' or you can revert to your original on
-- screen window buffer.
--
-- [@offscreen@] If you are setting a draw buffer of type
-- COGL_OFFSCREEN_BUFFER then this is @Just@ a CoglHandle for the offscreen
-- buffer. @Nothing@ for a window buffer.
