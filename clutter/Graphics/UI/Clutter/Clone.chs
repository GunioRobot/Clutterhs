-- | Clone â€” An actor that displays a clone of a source actor
module Graphics.UI.Clutter.Clone (
-- * Description
--
-- | 'Clone' is an Actor which draws with the paint function of
-- another actor, scaled to fit its own allocation.
--
-- 'Clone' can be used to efficiently clone any other actor.
--
-- * Note
--
-- This is different from 'textureNewFromActor' which requires support
-- for FBOs in the underlying GL implementation.
--
-- 'Clone' is available since Clutter 1.0
