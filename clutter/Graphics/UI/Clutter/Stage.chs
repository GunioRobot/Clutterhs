-- | 'Stage' â€” Top level visual element to which actors are placed.
module Graphics.UI.Clutter.Stage (
-- * Detail
-- | 'Stage' is a top level 'window' on which child actors are placed
-- and manipulated.
--
-- Clutter creates a default stage upon initialization, which can be
-- retrieved using 'stageGetDefault'. Clutter always
-- provides the default stage, unless the backend is unable to create
-- one. The stage returned by 'stageGetDefault' is
-- guaranteed to always be the same.
--
-- Backends might provide support for multiple stages. The support for
-- this feature can be checked at run-time using the
-- 'clutterFeatureAvailable' function and the
-- CLUTTER_FEATURE_STAGE_MULTIPLE flag. If the backend used supports
-- multiple stages, new 'Stage' instances can be created using
-- 'stageNew'. These stages must be managed by the developer
-- using 'actorDestroy', which will take care of destroying
-- all the actors contained inside them.
--
-- 'Stage' is a proxy actor, wrapping the backend-specific
-- implementation of the windowing system. It is possible to subclass
-- 'Stage', as long as every overridden virtual function chains up
-- to the parent class corresponding function.

-- | Returns the main stage. The default 'Stage' is a singleton, so

--   'Stage' returned by 'stageNew'.
--
--   The ability to support multiple stages depends on the current

--  handler will call Cogl.setFog with the desired settings, like:

--
--  Note: The fogging functions only work correctly when the visible
--  actors use unmultiplied alpha colors. By default Cogl will
--  premultiply textures and 'Cogl.setSourceColor' will premultiply
--  colors, so unless you explicitly load your textures requesting an
--  unmultiplied internal_format and use Cogl.materialSetColor you
--  can only use fogging with fully opaque actors.
