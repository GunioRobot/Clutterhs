-- | 'Stage' â€” Top level visual element to which actors are placed.
module Graphics.UI.Clutter.Stage (
-- * Detail
-- | ClutterStage is a top level 'window' on which child actors are placed and manipulated.
--
-- Clutter creates a default stage upon initialization, which can be
-- retrieved using 'stageGetDefault'. Clutter always
-- provides the default stage, unless the backend is unable to create
-- one. The stage returned by 'stageGetDefault' is
-- guaranteed to always be the same.
--
-- Backends might provide support for multiple stages. The support for
-- this feature can be checked at run-time using the
-- 'clutterFeatureAvailable' function and the
-- CLUTTER_FEATURE_STAGE_MULTIPLE flag. If the backend used supports
-- multiple stages, new 'Stage' instances can be created using
-- 'stageNew'. These stages must be managed by the developer
-- using 'actorDestroy', which will take care of destroying
-- all the actors contained inside them.
--
-- 'Stage' is a proxy actor, wrapping the backend-specific
-- implementation of the windowing system. It is possible to subclass
-- 'Stage', as long as every overridden virtual function chains up
-- to the parent class corresponding function.

-- | Sets the fog (also known as "depth cueing") settings for the stage.
--
--  A 'Stage' will only use a linear fog progression, which depends

--  disabling the "use-fog" property and connecting a signal handler to
--  the "paint" signal on the stage, like:
-- TODO: The equivalent example
--
--  Note: The fogging functions only work correctly when the visible
--  actors use unmultiplied alpha colors. By default Cogl will premultiply
--  textures and cogl_set_source_color will premultiply colors, so unless
--  you explicitly load your textures requesting an unmultiplied
--  internal_format and use cogl_material_set_color you can only use
--  fogging with fully opaque actors.
